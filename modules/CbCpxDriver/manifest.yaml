  min_current_A:
    description: >-
      The minimum current in ampere which can be imported/exported. The default value
      of 6 A corresponds to the lowest value which is technically possible to signal
      by the IEC 61851 standard via PWM.
    type: number
    default: 6
  max_current_A:
    description: >-
      The maximum current in ampere which can be imported/exported. Here too,
      the default corresponds to the maximum value which is possible to signal
      with the IEC 61851 standard. The value should be adjusted if there is no
      other limitating value/instance which represents the physical charger limits.
