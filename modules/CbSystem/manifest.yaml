  reset_delay:
    description: >-
      When receiving a reset request, then the actual execution can be delayed by this amount of time (given in seconds).
      This might be necessary, for example, when the reset request arrives via the network and the call acknowledgement
      should be given some time to travel the return path to the caller.
      Defaults to 3, which means that the reset is delayed for 3 seconds.

    default: 3

      small jumps of system time.
