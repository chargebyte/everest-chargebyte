  switch_3ph1ph_wiring:
    description: >-
      Tells the implementation which wiring configuration for phase-count
      switching is used:
      - 'none': no phase-count switching setup
      - 'serial': the secondary contactor is wired in series to the primary contactor
      - 'mutual': the secondary contactor is wired in parallel to the primary contactor
      In 'serial' setups, the secondary contactor is closed before the primary
      contactor, and the primary contactor is opened before the secondary one.
      This ensures that the desired phases are offered to the vehicle at the same time.
      In 'mutual' setups, the primary contactor switch all available phases while the
      secondary contactor only switches a single phase. Both contactors are wired
      parallel, so that only exactly one contactor must be switched on at the same time.
      See user guide for wiring schematics and details.
