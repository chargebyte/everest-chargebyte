  switch3to1phase:
    description: Allows switching between single-phase and three-phase AC charging dynamically
    type: boolean
    default: false
  pluggable:
    description: ->
      Indicates whether the charging cable is attached to the EVSE with a plug into a socket.
      Set to true when the charge port is equipped with a socket connector, i.e.
      the cable is not fixed. Set to false when the charge port has a fixed cable.
    type: boolean
    default: true
  cable_current_limit:
    description: ->
      In case of a fixed cable this value controls how much current (in Ampere) is
      supported by the physical cable. If the config "pluggable" is set to true,
      then the cable current limit is determined by the plugged-in cable
      and this parameter has no effect.
