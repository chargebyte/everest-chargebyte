  can_source_address:
    description: >-
      The source address to use (aka controller address).
      Possible range is 0xf0..0xf8 (i.e. decimal 240..248)
      Default value: 0xf0 (240)

    default: 240
  can_destination_address:
    description: >-
      The destination address to use (aka module group address).
      The module group address is configured by using DIP switches
      for example at the power module(s).
      Possible range is 0..60 (decimal)
      Default value: 0
    type: integer
    minimum: 0

      When this value is greater than or equal to zero, the value is used to
      override the maximum supported current reported to EVerest in the power
      module capabilities. The value is expected in Ampere.
      To disable this override, use any negative number,
      then the value reported by the power module itself is used.
    type: number
    default: -1
  override_max_power:
    description: >-
      When this value is greater than or equal to zero, the value is used to
      override the maximum supported power reported to EVerest in the power
      module capabilities. The value is expected in Watts.
      To disable this override, use any negative number,
      then the value reported by the power module itself is used.
