types:
  CPState:
    description: >-
      Control Pilot related states.

      PowerOn: initial state when powering on, for nice logging.

      A-F: CP states as defined in IEC61851-1

      PilotFault: Measured Control Pilot out of expected range.
    type: string
    enum:
      - PowerOn
      - A
      - B
      - C
      - D
      - E
      - F
      - PilotFault
  ContactorState:
    description: Models the state of a contactor
    type: string
    enum:
      - Unknown
      - Open
      - Closed
  ContactorFeedbackType:
    description: >-
       Models the feedback type of the auxiliary contact of the contactor:
       none - no feedback signal is used
       nc - the feedback signal is wired to a normally-closed contact
       no - the feedback signal is wired to a normally-open contact
       Notes:
       - we have to use quotes here to force string evaluation,
         otherwise "no" would be converted to "False".
       - we use lower-case strings to match the manifest configuration values
    type: string
    enum:
      - "none"
      - "nc"
      - "no"
